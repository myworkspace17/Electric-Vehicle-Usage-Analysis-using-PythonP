About the Project:
The "Electric Vehicle Usage Analysis Using Python" project aims to explore and analyze a dataset of electric vehicles (EVs) to uncover insights regarding their usage, adoption trends, and key characteristics. With the growing emphasis on sustainable transportation, electric vehicles have become a significant part of the automotive industry. This project provides an in-depth analysis of the factors influencing the adoption of electric vehicles, such as vehicle type, model year, electric range, and geographic distribution.

The dataset used in this project contains detailed information on electric vehicles, including their model year, electric range, vehicle type (BEV, PHEV), and various other attributes. By performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques, the project aims to:

Understand the trends in electric vehicle adoption: This includes analyzing the growth in the number of EVs, understanding which vehicle types (BEVs vs. PHEVs) are more prevalent, and how they have evolved over the years.

Identify the most popular electric vehicle models: By counting the number of vehicles by model and type, the project identifies which models are leading in terms of adoption.

Examine geographic distribution: The analysis looks at how EVs are distributed across different regions, such as cities and census tracts, to understand which areas have higher concentrations of electric vehicles.

Evaluate the impact of model year and electric range: It analyzes how newer models compare to older ones in terms of electric range, highlighting trends in battery technology and EV performance.

This project uses Python and several powerful libraries, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy, to perform data analysis and visualization, making it easy to identify patterns and trends within the data.

Libraries Used:
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib: For visualizing data using various plots (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots).
Seaborn: For advanced statistical visualizations (e.g., count plots, histograms).
NumPy: For handling numerical operations.
Key Steps and Outputs:
Data Import:

The dataset is imported into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
Data Cleaning:

Missing or null values are checked and removed, ensuring the dataset is complete and ready for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

A statistical summary of the data is generated.
Visualizations like scatter plots and bar plots are created to understand the relationships between model year and electric range, as well as the distribution of EV types over time.
Analysis of Electric Vehicle Types:

The dataset is filtered to focus on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
The top models for both BEVs and PHEVs are identified based on the count of vehicles.
Geographic Distribution:

The dataset is analyzed to understand the distribution of EVs across different cities and 2020 Census Tracts, highlighting regions with the highest adoption.
Visualization:

Bar charts, scatter plots, and count plots are used to visually represent the data, making it easier to interpret trends and patterns in the EV market.
Conclusion:
This analysis offers a comprehensive view of the electric vehicle landscape, including:

Growth in Electric Range: Over time, electric vehicles have improved in terms of their electric range, with newer models offering better performance.
Dominance of BEVs: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are more widely adopted compared to Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
Vehicle Popularity: Certain vehicle models, especially BEVs, are leading in terms of adoption.
Geographical Insights: The geographic distribution of EVs shows higher concentrations in specific regions, which could inform infrastructure planning for charging stations and policy development.
This project provides valuable insights into the trends and patterns of electric vehicle adoption, with the potential for further analysis into regional infrastructure, pricing, and market factors influencing EV sales.
